# esignature-status-using-docusign-envelop
This project used docusign evvelopid and get details like transactions, logins, etc from esignature. On top of that you can do operation like delete transaction from esignature or verify any document is complete of not.


#Hoe it works

There are two classes in the project.one contains configuration and other contains all the methods to access eSignature properties. you can input docusign envelope id and get the properties of esignature like status, creation date, etc

This java piece of code is using httpGet method to access esignature properties using docusign envelop id. in other application ruby has beed used but this one is in java and help java developer to do their job without switching from java to ruby.
